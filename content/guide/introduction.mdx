# Introduction
 
JellyCAD is a digital resource for learning how to use CAD for the FIRST Tech Challenge! In this guide, we’ll teach you how to harness the capabilities of Fusion360 for your FTC robot, starting with simple modeling all the way to complex part modeling and large assemblies. 

## What is CAD?
CAD (Computer-Aided Design) is essentially 3D modeling for engineering. Robotics teams use it to design and print custom-made parts for their robots, as well as to visualize their robots prior to building them. In this way, CAD can serve as a blueprint for building the robot, saving time in the long run. 

## What is Fusion360?
Fusion360 is a CAD software that allows us to model, animate, and render robot parts. We chose Fusion360 because it has a wide range of modeling capabilities despite being relatively easy to learn.

This guide consists of **modules**, which come with series of lessons. Every lesson has a tutorial and a mini project. At the end of each module is a **capstone project** designed to test what you’ve learned. Since this guide is written within the context of FTC, all projects will be robotics-related, like designing a screw sorter, claw, or entire robot!
